# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning models. By analyzing transaction features such as amount and behavioral anomalies, the system classifies whether a given transaction is legitimate or fraudulent. The solution also includes data visualizations using Power BI to explore fraud trends and assist with decision-making.
